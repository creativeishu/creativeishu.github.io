<p>I am a physicist, specializing in extra-galactic astrophysics and cosmology. Currently I work at <a href="www.fnal.gov">Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory</a> as Research Associate Post-Doctoral Fellow. My research focusses on understanding the dynamics and energy content of the Universe, also its origin and evolution. I have been involved in projects aiming to forecast the systematics and predict the results of some future space telescope missions like eRosita, Euclid etc.</p>

<p>For my research I use many different tools from statistics, mathematics, computer programming and computational recipes.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Programming Languages</strong> : Python (Numpy,Scipy), C++, Fortran90, Matlab, Bash.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Mathematics and Statistics</strong> : MCMC, Fisher Analysis, Genetic-Algorithm, Statistical Inference, Numerical Methods, Data Mining, Linear Algebra.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>I am interested in mathematical modeling, analysis of big data, simulation models, financial markets, quantitative finance and research. I can leverage the skills I acquired during my studies to solve interesting problems in various different domains.</p>

<p>Pursued research in computational astrophysics and cosmology. I used analytical, statistical and computational tools to predict cosmological observations, and to compute useful constraints on any deviation from the standard model of cosmology which, if confirmed with high signicance, will give rise to new physics.</p>
